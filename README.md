# Maze
Implementing JS to get the functionality of arrow keys, make sure that the mouse cannot get past the barriers, otherwise the game will not be functional.


implementing a drop down with 4 different difficulties so that the user can have a wider range if they find it easy

each time start button is pressed, the game with change the maze automatically and randomly so that the maps are not the same.
